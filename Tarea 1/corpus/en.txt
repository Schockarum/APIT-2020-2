The Mexican peso cut a three-session upward streak on Friday after S&P downgraded Mexico's credit rating and that of state oil company Pemex amid the crisis over the spread of the coronavirus.
In the madrigada the local currency traded at 23.35 per dollar, a loss of 1.83 percent, compared to 22.93 of the reference price of Reuters on Thursday.
S&P downgraded Mexico's long-term foreign currency credit rating to "BBB" from "BBB+" on Thursday, maintaining its negative outlook, reflecting the possibility of further downgrades to the sovereign rating over the next 12 to 24 months at the height of the coronavirus crisis.
The agency also lowered Pemex's credit rating to "BBB" with a negative perspective.
Meanwhile, JP Morgan said Thursday that it expects the Mexican economy to shrink by 7 percent this year and by 35.5 percent in the second quarter at an annual rate.
To Christmas Carol. In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas - commonly known as A Christmas Carol and translated into Spanish as Canción de Navidad, Cuento de Navidad or El cántico de Navidad - is a short novel written by British author Charles Dickens and originally published by Chapman & Hall on December 19, 1843. Its plot tells the story of a greedy and selfish man named Ebenezer Scrooge and his conversion after being visited by a series of ghosts on Christmas Eve.
The book was written and distributed during the Victorian period, when a sense of nostalgia for the old Christmas traditions prevailed and customs such as Christmas trees were beginning to be introduced. A variety of concepts and publications influenced Dickens in writing his work, although his childhood experiences, his sympathy for the poor, and several Christmas stories and fairy tales stand out.
Its contribution to the contemporary way of celebrating Christmas as a time of family integration and festivity, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States, has maintained its popularity over time, and it has since been translated into various languages and adapted to various media such as film, theatre and television.
Daniel Jacob Radcliffe (born 23 July 1989) is an English actor and producer. He is best known for playing the titular protagonist in the Harry Potter film series during his adolescence and early adulthood.
Born and raised in London, Radcliffe made his acting debut at 10 years of age in BBC One's 1999 television film David Copperfield, followed by his cinematic debut in 2001's The Tailor of Panama. At age 11, he was cast as Harry in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Over the next 10 years, Radcliffe played the lead role in seven more Harry Potter films, culminating with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011). During this period, Radcliffe became one of the highest-paid actors in the world; earned worldwide fame, popularity, and critical acclaim; and received many accolades for his performances in the series.
Following the success of the Harry Potter films, Radcliffe portrayed lawyer Arthur Kipps in the Edwardian horror film The Woman in Black (2012); famed beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the independent film Kill Your Darlings (2013); Victor Frankenstein's assistant, Igor, in the science fiction fantasy Victor Frankenstein (2015); Manny, a sentient corpse in the comedy-drama Swiss Army Man (2016); technological prodigy Walter Mabry in the heist thriller film Now You See Me 2 (2016); and FBI agent Nate Foster in the critically-acclaimed thriller Imperium (2016). Radcliffe began to branch out to stage acting in 2007, starring in the London and New York productions of Equus and in the 2011 Broadway revival of the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Since 2018, Radcliffe has starred in the TBS anthology television series Miracle Workers.
Radcliffe has contributed to many charities, including Demelza Hospice Care for Children and The Trevor Project; the latter charity gave him its Hero Award in 2011.
The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering. Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centres of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago. Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago, and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was bred into maize by 6,000 years ago. Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.
The Big Bang theory is a cosmological model of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of very high density and high temperature, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, large-scale structure, and Hubble's law – the farther away galaxies are, the faster they are moving away from Earth. If the observed conditions are extrapolated backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the prediction is that just before a period of very high density there was a singularity. Current knowledge is insufficient to determine if the singularity was primordial.
Georges Lemaître first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, calling his theory that of the "primeval atom". For much of the rest of the 20th century scientific community was divided between supporters of the Big Bang and the rival Steady-state model, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang, which is now universally accepted. Edwin Hubble concluded from analysis of galactic redshifts in 1929 that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence for an expanding universe. In 1964, the CMB was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the hot Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of a background radiation throughout the universe.
The known laws of physics can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail back in time to an initial state of extreme density and temperature. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After its initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium – later coalesced through gravity, forming early stars and galaxies, the descendants of which are visible today. Besides these primordial building materials, Astronomers observe the gravitational effects of an unknown dark matter surrounding galaxies. Most of the gravitational potential in the universe seems to be in this form, and the Big Bang theory and various observations indicate that it is not conventional baryonic matter that forms atoms. Measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence.
